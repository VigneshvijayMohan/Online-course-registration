# Online-course-registration

Objective:

Develop a RESTful API for an online course registration system . The API should allow for operations like creating courses, registering a student for a course, dropping a course, and viewing course enrollment.

Features:

Create entities such as Course (id, name, capacity, currentEnrollment) and Registration (id, courseld, studentid).

Implement endpoints for creating courses, registering a student for a course, dropping a course, and viewing course enrollment.

Implement exception handling to return appropriate error responses.


In each of these projects, developers should also be encouraged to write unit tests and integration tests, document their API using Swagger or a similar tool, and push their code to a Git repository for review. 
As with the previous assignment, adherence to Spring Boot best practices and conventions, the quality of code, error handling, implementation of security, quality of tests, clarity of API documentation, and ease of deployment should all be considered in your evaluation
